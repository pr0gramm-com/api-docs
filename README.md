## API State
At the current state, pr0gramm's API is considered **unstable** and is **not versioned**.
However, we try to avoid large breaking changes but cannot give any guarantee that it won't happen. You can join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/uAAnNmHRuJ) and get notified on when are about to deploy breaking API changes.
Our discord community is open for everyone who wants to develop _anything_ that has to do with pr0gramm and/or uses the API. Bots, services, User Scripts; you name it.

## [OAuth 2.0](OAuth.md)
pr0gramm.com supports OAuth 2.0 using *Grant Code Authorization* to do API requests.
You can use this to provide a "Log in with pr0gramm" experience for your application as well as accessing API endpoints with user credentials without needing their password.
